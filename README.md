# Samples for IBM Cloud App Configuration
App Configuration is a centralized feature management and configuration service for use with web and mobile applications, micro-services, and distributed environments.

These samples are aimed at providing a way to quickly configure App Configuration service for running demos and exploring functionality. They are not designed for production use. All samples are relatively small so that they can be re-used easily and integrated into a larger use-case.
